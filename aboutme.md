<h2 style="color:rgb(242,99,152)"> About Me \(o_o)/ </h2>

<h4> I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Massachusetts 
Amherst, working with Kate Whitaker & Francesco Valentino (at DAWN, Copenhagen) 
on the star-formation histories of massive quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon. 
Prior to this position, I completed a PhD at the Institute for Astronomy, 
University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of Ross McLure. 
I studied size-mass relations, star-formation histories and quenching mechanisms 
of quiescent galaxies at z ~ 1 using a range of data from the ESO Public 
Spectroscopic Survey VANDELS, and the JWST PRIMER program. </h4>

<h2 style="color:rgb(242,99,152)"> Outreach </h2>

<h4> I'm currently involved in some outreach events at UMass and within the surrounding areas. Astronomy on Tap happens every third Tuesday of the month from September until May. Watch this space for updates on events near you! </h4>

<h4> I'm also involved in a few collaborations in the hopes that I can help to make the world a little bit better. See links below to find out and join if you're interested! </h4>
