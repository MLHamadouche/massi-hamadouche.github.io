  about: |
    I recently started a postdoc at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, 
    working with Kate Whitaker & Francesco Valentino (at DAWN, Copenhagen) on the star-formation histories of 
    massive quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon. Prior to this position, I completed a PhD at the 
    Institute for Astronomy, University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of Ross McLure. 
    I studied size-mass relations, star-formation histories and quenching mechanisms of quiescent galaxies at z ~ 1 
    using a range of data from the ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey VANDELS, and the JWST PRIMER program.
