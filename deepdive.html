<p>
The DeepDive survey is a *JWST* Cycle 2 spectroscopic program (ID: 3567, PI: F. Valentino) targeting ten massive quiescent galaxies to obtain deep, high signal-to- noise, high-quality, medium-resolution spectroscopy between *3 < z < 4* using the NIRCam and NIRSpec instruments aboard *JWST*.

    <strong>Figure 1.</strong> Spectra for the three highest redshift galaxies at <em>3 &lt; z &lt; 4</em> in the DeepDive sample (the rest of the galaxies are shown in the Appendix). The best-fitting Bagpipes model is over-plotted in purple, and the observed photometry along with the model SED is shown in the inset panel.
