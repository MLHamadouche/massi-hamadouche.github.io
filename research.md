The DeepDive survey is a *JWST* Cycle 2 spectro- scopic program (ID: 3567, PI: F. Valentino) targeting ten massive quiescent galaxies to obtain deep, high signal-to- noise, high-quality, medium-resolution spectroscopy between *3 < z < 4* using the NIRCam and NIRSpec instruments aboard *JWST*.

    <strong>Figure 2.</strong> The size evolution of quiescent and star-forming galaxies within three different stellar-mass ranges (for all, low-mass, and high-mass galaxies, respectively). We find that the slope of the relation followed by low-mass quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable from that followed by low-mass star-forming galaxies. We also find that high-mass star-forming galaxies evolve more rapidly than low-mass star-forming galaxies. However, at high stellar masses it is clear that quiescent galaxies experience much more rapid size evolution than their star-forming counterparts. Uncertainties on the median values are derived via bootstrap resampling. Error bars correspond to the interval between the 16th and 84th percentiles of the distribution.
