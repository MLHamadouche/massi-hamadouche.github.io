<p>
 Using high-quality imaging and photometry from the JWST PRIMER Survey (PI: Dunlop), I selected large samples of quiescent galaxies over a wide stellar mass and redshift range to investigate whether or not low-mass quiescent galaxies are morphologically different to their higher mass counterparts. In this paper, I find that at all redshifts, low-mass quiescent galaxies are more disk-like than high-mass quiescent galaxies, and possess a shallower size-mass relation, more consistent with the star-forming relation over the same stellar-mass range.

    <strong>Figure 2.</strong> The size evolution of quiescent and star-forming galaxies within three different stellar-mass ranges (for all, low-mass, and high-mass galaxies, respectively). We find that the slope of the relation followed by low-mass quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable from that followed by low-mass star-forming galaxies. We also find that high-mass star-forming galaxies evolve more rapidly than low-mass star-forming galaxies. However, at high stellar masses it is clear that quiescent galaxies experience much more rapid size evolution than their star-forming counterparts.
